# General Purpose
This Repository is used to maintain, share, and improve VBA scripts that focus primarily on Document Management in the Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) Industry.

# Intended Usage
Most of these scripts are intended to be used with data entered into a Macro-enabled Excel Workbooks (xlsm).
Such Workbooks are often used to track information related to large volumes of documents.
These scripts extend the benefit of tabulating this information by creating folders, copying templates, and generating standard form emails.

There is a great variety in the data that must be tracked by each project. 
Typically, separate scripts are written to gather data from some source and then used as inputs for other subroutines.
Since much of this data is taken from tabulated information, most subroutines are written to accept Arrays as their input.

# How to Deploy These Scripts
The best way to use these scripts is to store them within Macro-enabled Excel Workbooks (xlsm).
Each Workbook should be designed with structured tables for storing the information that is used by the scripts saved within.
These Workbooks would then serve as templates for different types of data to be collected.
These Workbooks can then be stored in a central location where company personnel can retrieve the template for use on their project.

## Benefits
1. Instructing individuals on using structured tables is simple.
2. The individuals collecting the data do not need keep their Personal Workbook up-to-date with the latest scripts.
3. Each project can have a unique Workbook tailored to their project.

## Drawbacks
1. Scripts must be copied from this repository into other files.
2. Workbooks will rarely have the most-up-to-date scripts.
3. Updating a faulty script requiring identify all Workbooks in which a copy is stored.
